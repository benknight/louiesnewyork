        <p class="lh-copy f6 measure">
          Hey everyone, Louie’s New York is personal project of mine with the goal of being the most comprehensive database of filming locations in Louie, no matter how small or insignificant.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy f6 measure">
          I’ve always felt that maps provide an interesting connection between stories and reality.  And like in many great stories, New York is not just the place where the main character Louie’s stories take place, but a almost like a character in and of itself.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy f6 measure">
          Although I’ve never lived in New York, in my own personal travels I’ve come to appreciate this city as a fountain of humanity, where one can experience the full spectrum of life.  My hope is that through this collected data it becomes possible for New Yorkers and non-New Yorkers to gain a fresh perspective on this city, experiencing it through the eyes of comedian Louis CK, who undoubtedly loves New York.

          Louie’s New York is a work in progress!  So far I have only documented Season 1, but my eventual goal is to document the entire series.  The way I usually identify a location is by searching for landmarks in the background of a scene (street signs, business signs, etc) but sometimes I just can’t figure it out. But I don’t want to skip anything, so when this happens I add it to my <a class="link light-blue underline-hover" href="https://airtable.com/shrsbbCCImRHLBrCR">list of unknown locations</a>.  If you’re interested in helping out, you can <a class="link light-blue underline-hover" href="https://airtable.com/shrvcEwhfapBnuuDy">submit a location</a>.
